# Activation Functions Performance Comparisson with a simple Image classification model

This notebook contains a simple comparisson of the performance of different activation functions. The same model is used each time so the experiment can be fair. Also 2 different datasets are being tested here. The graphs of the comparisson were made using Weights & Biases and the wandb library. You can easily change it so the training results can be sent to your personal wandb repository so you can see the results of this experiment. The notebook was tested in the Google Collabs environment.
